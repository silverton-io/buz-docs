- No SaaS, DPA, MDS products, or dealing with legal necessary. ***Buz runs on your infrastructure***.
- Buz is a **lightweight** and **cost-efficient** way of collecting data.
- Buz **empowers teams to run their own data collection systems**.
- Buz is **quick to set up** and **easy to maintain long term** thanks to **minimal moving pieces**.
- Buz is serverless-native, and **automatically scales as data volumes do (including to `0`)**.
