# Postgres

**ðŸŸ¢ Supported**

The `postgres` schema cache backend leverages schemas stored in a configurable registry table.

It is most useful when you want to store `schemas`, `valid events`, and `invalid events` within the same system to reduce infrastructure overhead.

It can be used with any combination of sink(s).


## Sample Postgres Schema Cache Backend Configuration

```
registry:
  backend:
    type: postgres
    registryTable: registry
    pgHost: localhost
    pgPort: 5432
    pgDbName: buz
    pgUser: buz
    pgPass: buz
```
