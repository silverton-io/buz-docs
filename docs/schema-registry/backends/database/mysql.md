# MySQL

**🟢 Supported**

The `mysql` backend leverages schemas stored in a configurable registry table.

It is most useful when you want to store `schemas` and `events` within the same system to reduce infrastructure overhead.

It can be used with any combination of sink(s).


## Sample Mysql Schema Cache Backend Configuration

    registryTable: registry
