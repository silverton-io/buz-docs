# Roadmap 2023 ðŸŽ¯

## We have four goals for 2023.

  1. Stability and transparency. Robust tests, unchanging internals, and proactive comms.
  2. Increased production use cases - SIEM, infra migration, data lake management, and more.
  3. Improved developer tooling - config management, schema management, etc.
  4. Improved integrations within the data ecosystem.


## 2022 Year in Review

Buz was born on **[January 18, 2022](https://github.com/silverton-io/buz/commit/b7d9178a5987f880a87699d16428bc1ae08e5722)** as a serverless collector for Snowplow events. But it has become much more.

We quickly recognized the value in a lightweight event collector doesn't only lie in its **minimal infrastructure** and **cost efficiencies**, but also in its **flexibility**, its **openness**, and its **first-class support of pre-existing infrastructure preferences**.

### Buz has grown to support:

* **Five event protocols** with **misc payload validation capabilities**.
* **Nineteen event sinks** ranging from RDBMS's like Postgres, to streaming tech like Redpanda, to message brokers like NATS.
* **Ten schema registry backends** ranging from cloud object storage, to RDBMS's, to document stores.
* **A lightweight onboard schema registry**. (Yet-another piece of consolidated infrastructureâ„¢)
* **Serverless, hybrid-cloud deployments**. And they're [terraformed](https://github.com/silverton-io/buz/tree/main/deploy/terraform/aws/lambda) for anyone [to use](https://github.com/silverton-io/buz/tree/main/deploy/terraform/gcp).
* **Piles of operator-friendly mechanisms** including middleware, onboard statistics, dedicated sinks, **incremental schematization** and more.
* **A friendly envelope that gets out of the way but retains utility downstream.** The first one sucked - we fixed it.

### Buz misc:

- **>100k LOC written (or removed)**
- **>250 issues closed**
- **>90 releases**
- **Double-digit microsecond payload validation**
- **Spikes from 0 to >30k rps in the AWS Lambda free tier.**
- **Powers numerous (diverse) production systems.**
