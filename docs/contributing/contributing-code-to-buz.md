The following is a high-level overview of the steps involved when contributing code to Buz.


## Developing via fork


### Prerequisites

Buz is a project written in Go 1.19. You will need it to develop and that's really it.

:::danger Required for development
- [go 1.19](https://go.dev/blog/go1.19)
:::


:::info Niceties
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
:::


### Fork Buz

### Clone your fork

    git clone git@github.com:YOU/buz.git


### Bootstrap


**After `cd`ing into the `buz` directory you just cloned, run:**

    make bootstrap

**You should now have a local `config.yml` file and see console output like the following:**

```

```

### Running Tests

**To run `go test` and open up a browser-based coverage report run:**

    make test-cover-pkg


### Cut a PR from your fork back into buz `main` branch
